# Radionnettiste

This project "emulates" a traditional fm radio.
It works as a "carousel", where the only commands are previous and next radio in a circular list.
It uses puppetteer to access the web radios of a select few stations.

## Install

`npm i` or whatever equivalent in you favorite package manager.  
This program assumes there's a version of chrome installed at `/usr/bin/google-chrome`.

## Start

`node index.js`

## Motivation

This project is intended to allow my dad and his wife to listen to the radios they can not receive via fm frequencies, on a Raspberry Pi with no screen and a simple interface with only a page up and down button.
